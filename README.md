The worksheet contains the description of how the forward and back propogation works during the training process for a simple 2 input, 2 output and 2 layer Neural network

Forward Propogation:
Step 1: Calculate the output neurons ah1 and ah2 by multiplying the input i1 and i2 with w1, w2, w3 and w4 based on the network topology.
Step 2: Compute the output of activation functions ah1, ah2
Step 3: Compute the output o1 and o2 neurons of the second layer my multiplying weights w5,w6,w7 and w9 with a_h1 and a_h2 according to network topology
Step 4: Compute the output of activation functions a_o1, a_o2 
Step 5: Compute the Errors E1 and E2
Step 6: Compute the E_total by adding E1 and E2

Back propogation:
Step 1: Develop equation for the partial derivatives for E_total with respect to weights w8, w7, w6, w5
Step 2: Develop equation for the partial derivatives for E_total with respect to weights w4, w3, w2, w1 based on the substitution method provided Panel 4 and 5
Step 3: Initialize the value Î· the learning rate to 0.1
Step 4: Initialize the weights from w1 to w8
Step 5: Set the t1 and t2 target values to 0.5 and 0.5
Step 6: Update the formula derived from Step 1 and step 2 and update all the values in the worksheet
Step 7: Populate the vlaues for 66 epochs by dragging
Step 8: Modify the learning rate and observe the accuracy and convdrgence changing dynamically and the observations are listed below




Backward propogation:




For Learning rate = 0.1, the network does not seem to learn, even at Epoch 66, the accuracy still at 99%

For Learning rate = 0.2, there is a slight improvement but much less than needed

For Learning rate = 0.5, there seems to be a better convergence at Epoch 66 at 99.8

For Learning rate = 0.8, the accuracy seems to have acheived 99.9 % at Epoch 66

For Learning rate = 1, the accuracy is pretty good at 100% at Epoch 61

Learning rate = 2, the accuracy is achieved to 100 % very fast at Epoch 31 itslef
